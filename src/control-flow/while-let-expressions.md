# `while let` expressions

Like with `if`, there is a `while let` variant which repeatedly tests a value
against a pattern:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
    let mut iter = v.into_iter();

    while let Some(x) = iter.next() {
        println!("x: {x}");
    }
}
```

Here the iterator returned by `v.into_iter()` will return an `Option<i32>` on
every call to `next()`. It returns `Some(x)` until it is done, after which it
will return `None`. The `while let` lets us keep iterating through all items.

See [pattern matching](../pattern-matching.md) for more details on patterns in
Rust.
