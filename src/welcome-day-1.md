# Welcome to Day 1

This is the first day of Comprehensive Rust. We will cover a lot of ground
today:

* Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs,
  references, functions, and methods.

* Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory
  management, and garbage collection.

* Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.

The idea for the first day is to show _just enough_ of Rust to be able to speak
about the famous borrow checker. The way Rust handles memory is a major feature
and we should show students this right away.

If you're teaching this in a classroom, this is a good place to go over the
schedule. We suggest splitting the day into two parts (following the slides):

* Morning: 10:00 to 13:00 - Basic syntax.
* Afternoon: 14:00 to 17:00 - Memory management, and ownership. (**very important**)

You can of course adjust this as necessary. Please make sure to include breaks,
we recommend a break every hour!
