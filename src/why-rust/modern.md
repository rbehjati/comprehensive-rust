# Modern Features

Rust is built with all the experience gained in the last 40 years.

## Language Features

* Enums and pattern matching.
* Generics.
* No overhead FFI.

## Tooling

* Great compiler errors.
* Built-in dependency manager.
* Built-in support for testing.

No overhead FFI:
* To communicate with other languages, Rust provides a _foreign function interface_ (FFI). Following Rust's design principles, the FFI provides a **zero-cost abstraction** where function calls between Rust and C have identical performance to C function calls [[1]](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/24/Rust-Once-Run-Everywhere.html).

Key points:

* Remind people to read the errors --- many developers have gotten used to
  ignore lengthly compiler output. The Rust compiler is significantly more
  talkative than other compilers. It will often provide you with _actionable_
  feedback, ready to copy-paste into your code.

* The Rust standard library is small compared to languages like Java, Python,
  and Go. Rust does not come with several things you might consider standard and
  essential:

  * a random number generator, but see [rand].
  * support for SSL or TLS, but see [rusttls].
  * support for JSON, but see [serde_json].

  The reasoning behind this is that functionality in the standard library cannot
  go away, so it has to be very stable. For the examples above, the Rust
  community is still working on finding the best solution --- and perhaps there
  isn't a single "best solution" for some of these things.

  Rust comes with a built-in package manager in the form of Cargo and this makes
  it trivial to download and compile third-party crates. A consequence of this
  is that the standard library can be smaller.

  Discovering good third-party crates can be a problem. Sites like
  <https://lib.rs/> help with this by letting you compare health metrics for
  crates to find a good and trusted one.
